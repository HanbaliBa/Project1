# Predicting Annual Customer Spending in E-Commerce Using Multiple Linear Regression

### Overview
This project aims to predict the annual spending of customers on an e-commerce platform using Multiple Linear Regression in R. The goal is to help businesses better understand customer behavior and spending patterns, allowing for more informed decision-making in marketing and product offerings.

### Project Structure
- **Data**: The dataset contains customer-related information, such as age, gender, annual income, and other factors influencing spending behavior.
- **Model**: A Multiple Linear Regression model was developed to predict customer spending based on various features.
- **Tools**:
  - **R**: The primary language used for data processing, analysis, and modeling.
  - **Libraries**:
    - `ggplot2` (for data visualization)
    - `dplyr` (for data manipulation)
    - `caret` (for model training)
    - `lm()` (for linear regression modeling)

### Key Features
- **Exploratory Data Analysis**: Identified relationships between customer attributes and their spending.
- **Modeling**: Created a multiple linear regression model that explains a significant portion of the variance in annual customer spending.
- **Evaluation**: Used metrics such as R-squared, Adjusted R-squared, and RMSE to assess model performance.

### Results
- **Model Performance**: The model achieved an R-squared of 0.9842 on the test data, indicating how well the model explains the variation in customer spending.
- **Key Insights**:
  - Higher income customers tend to spend more annually.
  - Certain customer demographics exhibit different spending patterns.
