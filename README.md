<h1>Customer Spending Prediction</h1>
###Overview###
This project aims to predict the annual spending of customers on an e-commerce platform using Multiple Linear Regression in R. The goal is to help businesses better understand customer behavior and spending patterns, allowing for more informed decision-making in marketing and product offerings.
###Project Structure###
* __Data__: The dataset contains customer-related information, such as age, gender, annual income, and other factors influencing spending behavior.
* __Model__: A Multiple Linear Regression model was developed to predict customer spending based on various features.
* __Tools__:
  * __R__: The primary language used for data processing, analysis, and modeling.
  * __Libraries__:
    + ggplot2 (for data visualization)
    + dplyr (for data manipulation)
    + caret (for model training)
    + lm() (for linear regression modeling)
###Key Features###
* __Exploratory Data Analysis__: Identified relationships between customer attributes and their spending.
* __Modeling__: Created a multiple linear regression model that explains a significant portion of the variance in annual customer spending.
* __Evaluation__: Used metrics such as R-squared, Adjusted R-squared, and RMSE to assess model performance.
###Results###
* __Model Performance__: The model achieved an R-squared of 0.9842% on the test data, indicating how well the model explains the variation in customer spending.
* __Key Insights__:
  * Higher income customers tend to spend more annually.
  * Certain customer demographics exhibit different spending patterns.
